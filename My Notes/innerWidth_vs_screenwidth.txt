Here's a comparison of window.screen.width and window.innerWidth in JavaScript:

**Property	Description	Affected by Browser Size	Affected by Zoom Level**
window.screen.width	Represents the physical width of the user's entire screen, in pixels, regardless of browser window size or zoom level.	No	No
window.innerWidth	Represents the width of the browser viewport, in pixels, which is the visible area within the browser window.	Yes	Yes
Key Differences:

Screen Size vs. Viewport:
screen.width gives you the full screen dimensions, even if the browser window doesn't cover the entire screen.
innerWidth focuses on the viewable area within the browser.
Zoom Level:
innerWidth is affected by browser zoom levels, while screen.width remains constant.
When to Use Each:

screen.width:
Detecting multi-monitor setups.
Positioning elements relative to the full screen (e.g., for full-screen applications).
Accessing physical screen dimensions for device-specific adjustments.
innerWidth:
Creating responsive layouts that adapt to different browser viewports.
Positioning elements within the visible content area.
Handling user interactions within the browser window.
