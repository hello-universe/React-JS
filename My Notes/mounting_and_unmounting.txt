In React, mounting and unmounting refer to the processes of adding and removing components from the Document Object Model (DOM), the tree structure that represents the web page.

Here's a breakdown of each concept:

Mounting:

When a component is created and rendered for the first time, it's said to be "mounted."
React inserts the component's elements into the actual DOM, making them visible to the user.
This is when lifecycle methods like useEffect (with an empty dependency array) or the older componentDidMount are typically invoked.
It's the ideal time to perform actions that require DOM access, such as:
Setting up event listeners
Fetching data from external APIs
Manipulating native DOM elements directly
Unmounting:

When a component is removed from the DOM, it's said to be "unmounted."
This can happen due to:
User navigation to a different page
Conditional rendering that no longer includes the component
Parent component unmounting
React removes the component's elements from the DOM, making them invisible and inaccessible.
The useEffect hook's cleanup function (if provided) or the older componentWillUnmount method are called during unmounting.
It's crucial to use this stage to clean up resources and prevent potential issues, such as:
Removing event listeners
Canceling timers or intervals
Cleaning up subscriptions or data connections
Clearing cached data or temporary state
